Hi! My name is Kyrill, I'm a software engineer with a focus on mobile apps and particularly iOS.

The repositories I have here are currently mostly learning projects or code samples.

If you want to have a better idea of the kind of projects I worked on that are not open-source, read below.

## Apps I worked on:

### 1. Suggested for iOS:
- Personal project.
- An app that helps you write down music, movies and books recommendations in an organized way.
- See who recommended you what, where, and when.
- Written in **Objective-C**.
- Uses **Core Data** and syncs data over **iCloud**.
- Makes calls to multiple **APIs** to complete your recommendations (iTunes Store, Spotify, Google Books, TheMovieDB, etc).
- Has a clean UI for both **iPhone & iPad**.
